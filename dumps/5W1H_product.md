One of the best ways to describe the roles related to product
development goes like:

-   **Why** and the **What** is the product manager's responsibility
    (PM)

-   **How** is defined by the technical role, a principal engineer (PE)

-   **When** and **Who** provided by the engineering manager or a
    specialist, SEM or TPM

This makes intuitive sense given the roles and expectations with
examples like:

-   **Why** are we building this?

-   **What** do we need to build to meet the requirements?

-   **How** will we build to meet the requirements?

-   **When** can we deliver?

-   **Who** is best positioned to deliver?

These align well to the roles. However, discussion can quickly breakdown
in practice due to the flexibility of framing questions. Here are
examples from my direct experience:

-   **Why** are we designing it this way?

    -   Is both a valid PM question on iterative value and reducing
        reinvention, but is also a question we expect a PE to ask to
        answer the How and the SEM to answer When and potentially Who

-   **What** do our customers want most?

    -   Requires mapping Why logic on business impact to customer value
        and exploring the How to best meet that need in a reasonable
        timeline for When

-   **How** do we educate our user base about our product?

    -   More a What question of user need along with go-to-market
        motions involving When and a deeper look at user need this model
        doesn't reveal at first glance

-   **When** do we build this?

    -   More like a Why are we building this first to take
        prioritization into account, then consider the intersection of
        How, When, and Who to achieve a good first implementation of
        What

-   **Who** is our key persona?

    -   Essential part of Why logic and shows the ambiguity of Who

## Conclusion

The 5W1H mental model is **excellent advice for each role in a product
team**. Everyone involved in product development can benefit from
questioning what success looks like from a social, technical, and
business context.

My experience is that divvying up the questions can lead even
experienced teams to the wrong distribution of work while other models
can better align to expectations by role.
