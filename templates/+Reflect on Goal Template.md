### Why this goal?

_Write out the story you’re telling yourself about why this matters to you now and for the future._

  

### What obstacles will you have to overcome?

==_Being specific about challenges, rather than steps to success, has been show to set you on an effective path (source:_== ==[https://jkglei.com/](https://jkglei.com/)==)

  

### Who will you lean on for support or accountability along the way?

_No one achieved anything great alone. Remember you have people and plan to make them part of the process._

  

  

**Additional questions:**

- Will you need to **stop** doing something else in order to **start** down the path toward this goal?
- How will you show yourself your daily progress toward this goal? Is there a something you can tally (like words per day) or habits you can track (days you’ve practiced) to see the momentum? Where will you track it? Link it here.
